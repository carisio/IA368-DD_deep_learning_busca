            "Abstract: In traditional interactive English translation systems, English semantic context is not obvious in the process of the English translation, and the selection of optimal feature semantics does not reach the optimal translation solution, which leads to low translation accuracy. Toward this solation, a neural network (NN) based translation approach is proposed to predict word order differences in language translation and improve translation accuracy in long sentences. In this study, a multilayer NN model has been established to victories the unlabeled text words, realize the combination of word representation, vector features, and extract effective information of various sentences and semantics. In linear ranking frameworks, the NN is used to rank and score words, obtain semantic information of sample data, and predict the difference of word order. Experimental results show that the NN preorder model can significantly improve translation accuracy and system performance. The application of NN-based translation model in the practical translation process can reduce the effort of translation work, improve the efficiency of translation, and has a good practical significance.\n",

            "Abstract: Over the past few years, word embeddings and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) models have brought better solutions to learning text representations for natural language processing (NLP) and other tasks. Many NLP applications rely on pre-trained text representations, leading to the development of a number of neural network language models for various languages. However, this is not the case for Amharic, which is known to be a morphologically complex and under-resourced language. Usable pre-trained models for automatic Amharic text processing are not available. This paper presents an investigation on the essence of learned text representation for information retrieval and NLP tasks using word embeddings and BERT language models. We explored the most commonly used methods for word embeddings, including word2vec, GloVe, and fastText, as well as the BERT model. We investigated the performance of query expansion using word embeddings. We also analyzed the use of a pre-trained Amharic BERT model for masked language modeling, next sentence prediction, and text classification tasks. Amharic ad hoc information retrieval test collections that contain word-based, stem-based, and root-based text representations were used for evaluation. We conducted a detailed empirical analysis on the usability of word embeddings and BERT models on word-based, stem-based, and root-based corpora. Experimental results show that word-based query expansion and language modeling perform better than stem-based and root-based text representations, and fastText outperforms other word embeddings on word-based corpus.\n",

            "Abstract: We present an approach to unsupervised audio representation learning. Based on a Triplet Neural Network architecture, we harnesses semantically related cross-modal information to estimate audio track-relatedness. By applying Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) we embed corresponding textual information into a latent vector space from which we derive track relatedness for online triplet selection. This LSI topic modeling facilitates fine-grained selection of similar and dissimilar audio-track pairs to learn the audio representation using a Convolution Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN). By this we directly project the semantic context of the unstructured text modality onto the learned representation space of the audio modality without deriving structured ground truth annotations from it. We evaluate our approach on the Europeana Sounds collection and show how to improve search in digital audio libraries by harnessing the multilingual metadata provided by numerous European digital libraries. We show that our approach is invariant to the variety of annotation styles as well as to the different languages of this collection. The learned representations perform comparable to the baseline of handcrafted features, respectively exceeding this baseline in similarity retrieval precision at higher cut-offs with only 15% of the baseline's feature vector length.\n",

            "Abstract: The rapid development of remote sensing (RS) technology has produced massive images, which makes it difficult to obtain interpretation results by manual screening. Therefore, researchers began to develop automatic retrieval method of RS images. In recent years, cross-modal RS image retrieval based on query text has attracted many researchers because of its flexible and has become a new research trend. However, the primary problem faced is that the information of query text and RS image is not aligned. For example, RS images often have the attributes of multiscale and multiobjective, and the amount of information is rich, while the query text contains only a few words, and the information is scarce. Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has shown its potential in many tasks with its powerful feature representation ability. Therefore, based on GNN, this article proposes a new cross-modal RS feature matching network, which can avoid the degradation of retrieval performance caused by information misalignment by learning the feature interaction in query text and RS image, respectively, and modeling the feature association between the two modes. Specifically, to fuse the within-modal features, the text and RS image graph modules are designed based on GNN. In addition, in order to effectively match the query text and RS image, combined with the multihead attention mechanism, an image-text association module is constructed to focus on the parts related to RS image in the text. The experiments on two public standard datasets verify the competitive performance of the proposed model.\n",

In this study, the authors propose a novel specific category region proposal network (SCRPN) based on maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) and fully convolutional network (FCN) for natural scene text detection. First, FCN for pixel-level recognition is utilised to obtain the text saliency map and MSER is used to obtain oversegmented regions. Then, the multiple features of oversegmented regions and text saliency map are used for region aggregation. Next, single-linkage clustering method is adopted to cluster the segmentation regions to obtain a hierarchical structure of text region proposals. Finally, for the top-ranking region proposals, SCRPN built an end-to-end pipeline for scene text detection directly. Experiments on street view text and international conference on document analysis and recognition (ICDAR) 2013 have demonstrated the effectiveness of SCRPN for generating the text proposals. SCRPN could work with various two-stage text detection networks; thus, faster region convolutional neural network was used as the text detection framework to evaluate the performance of SCRPN in the ICDAR 2015 and MSRA-TD500 benchmarks. The experimental results confirmed that SCRPN makes text detection more robust in complex scenarios.\n",

            "Abstract: Multimodal representations and continual learning are two areas closely related to human intelligence. The former considers the learning of shared representation spaces where information from different modalities can be compared and integrated (we focus on cross-modal retrieval between language and visual representations). The latter studies how to prevent forgetting a previously learned task when learning a new one. While humans excel in these two aspects, deep neural networks are still quite limited. In this paper, we propose a combination of both problems into a continual cross-modal retrieval setting, where we study how the catastrophic interference caused by new tasks impacts the embedding spaces and their cross-modal alignment required for effective retrieval. We propose a general framework that decouples the training, indexing and querying stages. We also identify and study different factors that may lead to forgetting, and propose tools to alleviate it. We found that the indexing stage pays an important role and that simply avoiding reindexing the database with updated embedding networks can lead to significant gains. We evaluated our methods in two image-text retrieval datasets, obtaining significant gains with respect to the fine tuning baseline.\n",

To quickly build various prototypes of neural networks, we used Uber Ludwig framework (Molino et al., 2019): a toolbox built on top of TensorFlow, which facilitates and speeds up the training and testing of various models.

However, with the advent of modern deep neural networks, attention has shifted to discriminative ranking functions that model the semantic similarity of documents and queries instead. Recently, deep generative models such as GPT2 and BART have been shown to be excellent text generators, but their effectiveness as rankers have not been demonstrated yet. In this work, we revisit the generative framework for information retrieval and show that our generative approaches are as effective as state-of-the-art semantic similarity-based discriminative models for the answer selection task. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of unlikelihood losses for IR.\n",

Indeed, this latter function is a key component in the design of information retrieval metrics, as well as in the design of the ranking and sorting functions. Obtaining a good approximation for it thus opens the door to differentiable approximations of many evaluation measures that can in turn be used in neural end-to-end approaches. We first prove theoretically that the approximations proposed are of good quality, prior to validate them experimentally on both learning to rank and text-based information retrieval tasks.\n",

            "Abstract: Tagging has been recognized as a successful practice to boost relevance matching for information retrieval (IR), especially when items lack rich textual descriptions. A lot of research has been done for either multi-label text categorization or image annotation. However, there is a lack of published work that targets at item tagging specifically for IR. Directly applying a traditional multi-label classification model for item tagging is sub-optimal, due to the ignorance of unique characteristics in IR. In this work, we propose to formulate item tagging as a link prediction problem between item nodes and tag nodes. To enrich the representation of items, we leverage the query logs available in IR tasks, and construct a query-item-tag tripartite graph. This formulation results in a TagGNN model that utilizes heterogeneous graph neural networks with multiple types of nodes and edges. Different from previous research, we also optimize both full tag prediction and partial tag completion cases in a unified framework via a primary-dual loss mechanism. Experimental results on both open and industrial datasets show that our TagGNN approach outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-label classification approaches.\n",

            "Abstract: This article focuses on tackling the task of the cross-modal image–text retrieval which has been an interdisciplinary topic in both computer vision and natural language processing communities. Existing global representation alignment-based methods fail to pinpoint the semantically meaningful portion of images and texts, while the local representation alignment schemes suffer from the huge computational burden for aggregating the similarity of visual fragments and textual words exhaustively. In this article, we propose a stacked multimodal attention network (SMAN) that makes use of the stacked multimodal attention mechanism to exploit the fine-grained interdependencies between image and text, thereby mapping the aggregation of attentive fragments into a common space for measuring cross-modal similarity. Specifically, we sequentially employ intramodal information and multimodal information as guidance to perform multiple-step attention reasoning so that the fine-grained correlation between image and text can be modeled. As a consequence, we are capable of discovering the semantically meaningful visual regions or words in a sentence which contributes to measuring the cross-modal similarity in a more precise manner. Moreover, we present a novel bidirectional ranking loss that enforces the distance among pairwise multimodal instances to be closer. Doing so allows us to make full use of pairwise supervised information to preserve the manifold structure of heterogeneous pairwise data. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SMAN consistently yields competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n",

            "Abstract: The 1st International Workshop on Multimodal Understanding for the Web and Social Media (MUWS 2022) is co-located with The Web Conference (WWW) and held on the 26th of April, 20221. Multimodal learning and analysis is an emerging research area that cuts through several disciplines like Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Speech Processing, and Multimedia. Recently, several multimodal learning techniques have shown the benefit of combining multiple modalities in video representation learning and downstream tasks on videos. At the core, these methods are focused on modelling the modalities and their complex interactions by using large amounts of data, different loss functions and deep neural network architectures. Although these research directions are exciting and challenging, interdisciplinary fields such as semiotics are rarely considered. Literature in semiotics provides a detailed theory and analysis on meaning creation through signs and symbols via multiple modalities. In general, it provides a compelling view of multimodality and perception that can further expand computational research and applications on the web and social media. The goal of the interdisciplinary MUWS Workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from the fields of Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Human Computation, and Semiotics to discuss and evaluate methods and solutions for effective and efficient analytics of multimodal information present in the Web or social media. We are interested in approaches, tasks, and metrics for effectively analysing multimedia information such as image-text pairs and videos to design methodologies that jointly consider information from multiple modalities. The interdisciplinary nature of processing such multimodal data involves combining ideas and methods from the fields mentioned above. We envision the workshop as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia and industry for original contributions and practical application on multimodal information processing, mining, retrieval, search, and management. The workshop features advanced methods for combining visual and textual content for problems such as fake news detection, predicting reliability and popularity of news articles, generating image narrative with emotion, and injecting knowledge graph information to improve visual question answering performance. We would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the authors and presenters for their inspiring contributions to the workshop. Our sincere thanks are due to the program committee members for reviewing the submissions and ensuring the high quality of our workshop program. We also thank Ichiro Ide for his keynote talk, Chiao-I Tseng and Christian Otto for their invited talks in the workshop.

            "Abstract: With the rapid expansion of the Internet, intelligent question answering for information retrieval has once again gained widespread attention. However, current question answering models mainly focus on the general and common-sense questions in open domains and are incapable to effectively solve more complex professional domain questions. This paper proposed an integrated framework for Chinese intelligent question answering in restricted domains. The proposed model fused convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network which performs efficient semantic analysis on the question pairs to extract more effective features of the text. Meanwhile, the coattention mechanism and attention mechanism were combined to obtain the semantic interaction and feature representation of the question pair for providing complete information for subsequent calculations. In addition, we introduced the method of question pair matching to implement the Chinese intelligent question answering in a restricted domain. Experiments were tested and evaluated on the open-source CCKS2018 dataset and our private self-built inverted pendulum control question answering (IPC-QA) dataset for automation control virtual learning environment. Experimental results confirm that the proposed models are efficient and achieve a high precision of 0.86042 and 0.8031 on CCKS2018 and IPC-QA respectively.\n",

            "Abstract: The determination of semantic similarity between sentences is an important component in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text retrieval and text summarization. Many approaches have been proposed for estimating sentence similarity, and Siamese neural networks (SNN) provide a better approach. However, the sentence semantic representation, generated by sharing weights in the SNN without any attention mechanism, ignores the different contributions of different words to the overall sentence semantics. Furthermore, the attention operation within only a single sentence neglects interactive semantic influence on similarity estimation. To address these issues, an interactive self-attention (ISA) mechanism is proposed in this paper and integrated with an SNN, named an interactive self-attentive Siamese neural network (ISA-SNN) which is used to verify the effectiveness of ISA. The proposed model obtains the weights of words in a single sentence by means of self-attention and extracts inherent interactive semantic information between sentences via interactive attention to enhance sentence semantic representation. It achieves better performances without feature engineering than other existing methods on three biomedical benchmark datasets (a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.656 and 0.713/0.658 on DBMI and CDD-ful/-ref, respectively).\n",

            "Abstract: Existing neural ranking models follow the text matching paradigm, where document-to-query relevance is estimated through predicting the matching score. Drawing from the rich literature of classical generative retrieval models, we introduce and formalize the paradigm of deep generative retrieval models defined via the cumulative probabilities of generating query terms. This paradigm offers a grounded probabilistic view on relevance estimation while still enabling the use of modern neural architectures. In contrast to the matching paradigm, the probabilistic nature of generative rankers readily offers a fine-grained measure of uncertainty. We adopt several current neural generative models in our framework and introduce a novel generative ranker T-PGN, which combines the encoding capacity of Transformers with the Pointer Generator Network model. We conduct an extensive set of evaluation experiments on passage retrieval, leveraging the MS MARCO Passage Re-ranking and TREC Deep Learning 2019 Passage Re-ranking collections. Our results show the significantly higher performance of the T-PGN model when compared with other generative models. Lastly, we demonstrate that exploiting the uncertainty information of deep generative rankers opens new perspectives to query/collection understanding, and significantly improves the cut-off prediction task.\n",

            "Abstract: Various kinds of social networks develop explosively, such as online social networks, scientific cooperation networks, athlete networks, airport passage networks, and so on. With the large number of participants and real-time property, social networks increasingly demonstrate their strength in information dissemination. Social computing has become a promising research area and attracts lots of attention. Analyzing and mining human behaviors, topological structure, and information diffusion in social networks can help to understand the essential mechanism of macroscopic phenomena, discover potential public interest, and provide early warnings of collective emergencies. In the past, to study the characteristics of social networks, questionnaires were usually designed and volunteers in the network were invited to complete the questionnaires. However, the amount of data collected from questionnaires is nowhere near enough to understand thewhole perspective and essential mechanism of social events. With the development of mobile sensing, computer networks, and artificial intelligence in recent years, it is possible to collect plenty of data from various social networks. Big data in social networks also bring challenges to processing social data and investigating human behaviors. In addition, new and complex features in social networks occur nowadays, such as heterogeneous human properties, dynamic network structure, and random interpersonal interactions. Therefore, advanced multidisciplinary data collection and data mining methods should be proposed for social computing and developed to study social networks. This IEEE ACCESS Special Section on advanced data mining methods for social computing aims at bringing together researchers to disseminate their findings in the quickly growing field of social computing. The related theories and methods include machine learning algorithms, information theory, heuristic methods, mathematics, and computational and statistical physics. The Call for Papers aroused great enthusiasm in the scientific community and received 152 submissions. Out of these, 60 articles were accepted for inclusion in the Special Section after a thorough review process by at least two independent referees. The accepted articles can be categorized into five groups. The first group, with 16 articles, tackles the issues of natural language processing. The second group, with ten articles, tackles social multimedia mining. The third group, with 12 articles, addresses machine learning for social data. The fourth group, with nine articles, addresses social networking mining and topology analysis. The fifth group, with 13 articles, tackles user behavior modeling and preference analysis. In the first group, the article ‘‘Advanced quantum based neural network classifier and its application for objectionable web content filtering,’’ by Patel et al., designs a quantumbased neural network classifier as a Firewall to detect malicious Web requests on the Web and forms neural network architecture constructively by adding the hidden layer neuron one by one. The article by Das et al., ‘‘A graph-based clustering approach for relation extraction from crime data,’’ considers a textual corpus containing information on crimes against women in India and extracts substantial relations between the named entities present in the corpus using a hierarchical graph-based clustering technique.

            "Abstract: The effectiveness of Neural Information Retrieval (Neu-IR) often depends on a large scale of in-domain relevance training signals, which are not always available in real-world ranking scenarios. To democratize the benefits of Neu-IR, this paper presents MetaAdaptRank, a domain adaptive learning method that generalizes Neu-IR models from label-rich source domains to few-shot target domains. Drawing on source-domain massive relevance supervision, MetaAdaptRank contrastively synthesizes a large number of weak supervision signals for target domains and meta-learns to reweight these synthetic “weak” data based on their benefits to the target-domain ranking accuracy of Neu-IR models. Experiments on three TREC benchmarks in the web, news, and biomedical domains show that MetaAdaptRank significantly improves the few-shot ranking accuracy of Neu-IR models. Further analyses indicate that MetaAdaptRank thrives from both its contrastive weak data synthesis and meta-reweighted data selection.

            "Abstract: Representation learning is the foundation of natural language processing (NLP). This work presents new methods to employ visual information as assistant signals to general NLP tasks. For each sentence, we first retrieve a flexible number of images either from a light topic-image lookup table extracted over the existing sentence-image pairs or a shared cross-modal embedding space that is pre-trained on out-of-shelf text-image pairs. Then, the text and images are encoded by a Transformer encoder and convolutional neural network, respectively. The two sequences of representations are further fused by an attention layer for the interaction of the two modalities. In this study, the retrieval process is controllable and flexible. The universal visual representation overcomes the lack of large-scale bilingual sentence-image pairs. Our method can be easily applied to text-only tasks without manually annotated multimodal parallel corpora. We apply the proposed method to a wide range of natural language generation and understanding tasks, including neural machine translation, natural language inference, and semantic similarity. Experimental results show that our method is generally effective for different tasks and languages. Analysis indicates that the visual signals enrich textual representations of content words, provide fine-grained grounding information about the relationship between concepts and events, and potentially conduce to disambiguation.\n",

            "Abstract: With the growing availability of full-text articles, integrating abstracts and full texts of documents into a unified representation is essential for comprehensive search of scientific literature. However, previous studies have shown that naïvely merging abstracts with full texts of articles does not consistently yield better performance. Balancing the contribution of query terms appearing in the abstract and in sections of different importance in full text articles remains a challenge both with traditional bag-of-words IR approaches and for neural retrieval methods. In this work we establish the connection between the BM25 score of a query term appearing in a section of a full text document and the probability of that document being clicked or identified as relevant. Probability is computed using Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV), an isotonic regression algorithm, providing a maximum likelihood estimate based on the observed data. Using this probabilistic transformation of BM25 scores we show an improved performance on the PubMed Click dataset developed and presented in this study, as well as the 2007 TREC Genomics collection.\n",

            "Abstract: Question answering (QA) over text passages is a problem of longstanding interest in information retrieval. Recently, the conversational setting has attracted attention, where a user asks a sequence of questions to satisfy her information needs around a topic. While this setup is a natural one and similar to humans conversing with each other, it introduces a key research challenge: understanding the context left implicit by the user in follow-up questions. In this work, we demonstrate CROWN (Conversational passage ranking by Reasoning Over Word Networks): an unsupervised yet effective system for conversational QA with passage responses, that supports several modes of context propagation over multiple turns. To this end, CROWN first builds a word proximity network (WPN) from large corpora to store statistically significant term co-occurrences. At answering time, passages are ranked by a combination of their similarity to the question, and coherence of query terms within: these factors are measured by reading off node and edge weights from the WPN. CROWN provides an interface that is both intuitive for end-users, and insightful for experts for reconfiguration to individual setups. CROWN was evaluated on TREC CAsT data, where it achieved above-median performance in a pool of neural methods.\n",

            "Abstract: The use of stopwords has been thoroughly studied in traditional Information Retrieval systems, but remains unexplored in the context of neural models. Neural re-ranking models take the full text of both the query and document into account. Naturally, removing tokens that do not carry relevance information provides us with an opportunity to improve the effectiveness by reducing noise and lower document representation caching-storage requirements. In this work we propose a novel contextualized stopword detection mechanism for neural re-ranking models. This mechanism consists of training a sparse vector in order to filter out document tokens from the ranking decision. This vector is learned end-to-end based on the contextualized document representations, allowing the model to filter terms on a per occurrence basis. This leads to a more explainable model, as it reduces noise. We integrate our component into the state-of-the-art interaction-based TK neural re-ranking model. Our experiments on the MS MARCO passage collection and queries from the TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track show that filtering out traditional stopwords prior to the neural model reduces its effectiveness, while learning to filter out contextualized representations improves it.\n",

The smart court technologies can improve the efficiency of case handling and achieving convenience for the people. Article recommendation is an important part of intelligent trial. For ordinary people without legal background, the traditional information retrieval system that searches laws and regulations based on keywords is not applicable because they do not have the ability to extract professional legal vocabulary from complex case processes. This paper proposes a law recommendation framework, called LawRec, based on Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) and Skip-Recurrent Neural Network (Skip-RNN) models. It intends to integrate the knowledge of legal provisions with the case description and uses the BERT model to learn the case description text and legal knowledge, respectively. At last, laws and regulations for cases can be recommended. Experiment results show that the proposed LawRec can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods.\n",

            "Abstract: Document classification is a classical problem in information retrieval, and plays an important role in a variety of applications. Automatic document classification can be defined as content-based assignment of one or more predefined categories to documents. Many algorithms have been proposed and implemented to solve this problem in general, however, classifying Arabic documents is lagging behind similar works in other languages. In this paper, we present seven deep learning-based algorithms to classify the Arabic documents. These are: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), CNN-LSTM (LSTM = Long Short-Term Memory), CNN-GRU (GRU = Gated Recurrent Units), BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM), BiGRU, Att-LSTM (Attention-based LSTM), and Att-GRU. And for word representation, we applied the word embedding technique (Word2Vec). We tested our approach on two large datasets–with six and eight categories–using ten-fold cross-validation. Our objective was to study how the classification is affected by the stemming strategies and word embedding. First, we looked into the effects of different stemming algorithms on the document classification with different deep learning models. We experimented with eleven different stemming algorithms, broadly falling into: root-based and stem-based, and no stemming. We performed ANOVA test on the classification results using the different stemmers, which helps assure if the results are significant. The results of our study indicate that stem-based algorithms perform slightly better compared to root-based algorithms. Among the deep learning models, the Attention mechanism and the Bidirectional learning gave outstanding performance with Arabic text categorization. Our best performance is $F\\text {-score} = 97.96\\%$ , achieved using the Att-GRU model with stem-based algorithm. Next, we looked into different controlling parameters for word embedding. For Word2Vec, both skip-gram and bag-of-words (CBOW) perform well with either stemming strategies. However, when using a stem-based algorithm, skip-gram achieves good results with a vector of smaller dimension, while CBOW requires a larger dimension vector to achieve a similar performance.\n",

            "Toward English-Chinese Translation Based on Neural Networks [SEP] Introduction Machine translation (MT) has a long history. In 1949, War￾ren Weaver put forward the first influential machine transla￾tion proposal, which marked the beginning of machine translation [1]. In Weaver’s proposal, he mentioned the idea of computer translation and proposed to combine the knowl￾edge of statistics, logic, and linguistics to solve the problem of ambiguity in language. In the decades since, MT has come a long way. In 1949, the success of MT is started, but in the early decades of MT research, the so-called MT was almost entirely word-to-word substitution relying on bilingual dic￾tionaries. MT research soon fell into a cold winter. In 1966, the American Advisory Committee on Automatic Language Processing (ALPAC) pointed out in its research report lan￾guage and machine that “there is no hope for machine trans￾lation in the near future.”\n",
            "Toward English-Chinese Translation Based on Neural Networks [SEP] MT research soon fell into a cold winter. In 1966, the American Advisory Committee on Automatic Language Processing (ALPAC) pointed out in its research report lan￾guage and machine that “there is no hope for machine trans￾lation in the near future.” Since then, MT research has stagnated. It was not until 1980, with the increasing interna￾tional communication, that the urgency of MT led to the pre￾launch of MT research. As the research direction of natural language processing and artificial intelligence (AI), MT mainly uses computers to realize the mutual transformation between different languages [2–4]. At present, many Internet companies provide multiple language translation services online such as Google, Micro￾soft Bing translation, and hundred degrees translations. But the quality of MT still exists a bigger difference between professional translation, especially in the translation of some long sentences, the word order difference between the source language and target language is difficult to accurately describe.\n",
            "Toward English-Chinese Translation Based on Neural Networks [SEP] At present, many Internet companies provide multiple language translation services online such as Google, Micro￾soft Bing translation, and hundred degrees translations. But the quality of MT still exists a bigger difference between professional translation, especially in the translation of some long sentences, the word order difference between the source language and target language is difficult to accurately describe. To solve the problem of long-distance sequencing, many researches have been carried out. For example, the reordering model based on maximum entropy can achieve accurate translation of sentences through the relationship between different words in sentences. Some learners embed syntactic information of source language into the translation model, which effectively improves the description accuracy of long-distance reordering, but it is easy to prolong the decoding time of translation. Some scholars have proposed a preordering method, which directly converts the source language segment into the target language word order, effec￾tively solving the reordering problem in long sentence translation. In daily English translation, an interactive English trans￾lation system is usually used for English-Chinese translation, but the traditional interactive English translation system Hindawi Mobile Information Systems Volume 2022, Article ID 3114123, 8 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/3114123does not select the optimal feature context in the process of characteristic semantic and context extraction, resulting in low accuracy of the translation.\n"

Yu et al. [30] utilises graph transformers to capture the PRF signals from the initial retrieved results, and Wang et al. [27] proposed a clustering method to gather the relevance signals from PRF documents. These methods show remarkable improvements, but the efficiency is significantly affected, such as BERT-QE inference requires 11.01x more computations than BERT alone, making these models computationally infeasible for many practical applications. Recently, dense retrievers [29,16,7,8,6] have been attracting a lot of attention from researchers. These models, which often utilise a BERT-based dual-encoder to encode queries and passages into a shared embedding space, have shown great effectiveness and efficiency in various tasks and datasets.\n",

For AMI (Elis￾abetta Fersini, 2020), the second shared task at the 7th evaluation campaign EVALITA 2020 (Basile et al., 2020). Given the huge amount of user￾generated content on the Web, and in particular on social media, the problem of detecting, in order to possibly limit the diffusion of hate speech against women, is rapidly becoming fundamental espe￾cially for the societal impact of the phenomenon, it is very important to identify misogyny in social media. 1.1 Hate Speech (HaSpeeDe 2) In recent years, with the acceleration of infor￾mation dissemination, the identification of hate speech and offense language has become a crucial mission in multilingual sentiment analysis field￾s and has attracted the attention of a large num￾ber of industrial and academic researchers. From an NLP perspective, much attention has been paid to the topic of HS - together with all its possi￾ble facets and related phenomena, such as offen￾sive/abusive language, and its identification. This is shown by the proliferation, especially in the last few years, of contributions on this topic (e.g. 1 http://www.evalita.it/2020/tasks103 Caselli et al. (2020), Jurgens et al. (2019), Fortuna et al. (2019)), corpora and lexica (e.g. de Pelle and Moreira (2017), (Sanguinetti et al., 2018), (Bassignana et al., 2018)), dedicated workshop￾s, and shared tasks within national (GermEval 2 , HASOC 3 , IberLEF 4 ) and international (Se￾mEval 5 ) evaluation campaigns.

Moreover, most of them are not publicly accessible. Because of this, Amharic  NLP tasks have been performed using classical text representations such as stems and  roots [42,43], and the impact of learned text representations on roots, stems, and words to  the development of various applications is not yet investigated. Thus, the construction of  pre-trained Amharic models is a long sought resource for the research community. In  view of this, the major contributions of this work are: (i) construction of pre-trained Am￾haric models and publicly sharing them to the research community; (ii) fine-tuning the  pre-trained models for NLP and IR tasks; and (iii) investigation of the effects of roots,  stems, and surface words on learned text representations.  \n",

Preventing forgetting In the following we propose several tools to alleviate for￾getting by addressing the previous causes. 5.1. Preventing embedding drift A common approach to prevent forgetting is regularizing the weights with a quadratic term in the loss that penalizes the weighted Euclidean distance (in the parameter spaces) to the solution for previous tasks [27, 74, 1, 35]. This can help to avoid significant drift in the embeddings and to keep them discriminative for previous tasks. We can write the particular regularization term for our case as LR = X k Θ (t−1) k \u0010 θ (t−1) k −θk \u00112 + + X k0 Ω (t−1) k0 \u0010 ω (t−1) k0 −ωk0 \u00112\n",

As a result, it helps to embed rare words, misspelled words, and words that do not  exist in corpora but are found in the topic set. For example, the query term አገልግሎት /ʔəgəlɨgɨlotɨ ‘services’/ is not found in the corpora, and thus the word2vec and GloVe mod￾els do not return any expanded terms. However, fastText returns the words አገልግሎ /ʔəgəlɨgɨlo/, አገልግሎትም /ʔəgəlɨgɨlotɨmɨ/, አገልግሎትን /ʔəgəlɨgɨlotɨnɨ/, አገልግሎትና /ʔəgəlɨgɨlotɨna/,  አገልገሎት /ʔəgəlɨgəlotɨ/, አገልግሎቱንና /ʔəgəlɨgɨlotunɨna/, አገልገሎቱን /ʔəgəlɨgəlotunɨ/, አገልግሎቱን /ʔəgəlɨgɨlotunɨ/, and አገልግሎቱም /ʔəgəlɨgɨlotumɨ/, which are variants referring to the concept  “serve”.

Hypergraph structure acts as a constraint for random walking — while random walks in the Euclidean space can essentially take a step in any direction, in hyper￾graphs they are restricted to taking steps within the structure of the hypergraph. The idea of fatigue that we explore here is simply an added restriction, similar to the one we introduce when moving from the Euclidean space to a hypergraph space. Regarding fatigued random walks, it would be interesting to reiterate over the com￾putation approach of Fatigued PageRank, exploring a more approximate analogy to the combination of PageRank and Reverse PageRank, replacing the k ∗ vector with the Markov matrix used in Reverse PageRank and studying the differences. As￾suming we could represent hypergraph-of-entity as a tensor, we could also attempt to introduce the concept of fatigue in the Multilinear PageRank, so that we could completely rebuild the random walk score in its algebraic version, solvable through power iteration or other available, more efficient methods of PageRank computation, such as Monte Carlo (see Section A.2). 11.3.4 Promoting generalization through new applications We proposed what is, to our knowledge, the first general model for information re￾trieval.\n",

When all hyperedges in a hypergraph contain the same number k of nodes, the hypergraph is said to be k-uniform. In that case, it can be represented as a tensor of k dimensions, each of size |V|. In Section 2.2.5, we had covered tensor factorization over a tensor of entity relations for different predicates.

They tested the effectiveness of eleven ranking alternatives, discovering that the number of documents that cite an entity is more relevant than the number of times the entity is cited in the documents.

In all cases, the reformulated query is then re-executed on the traditional (so-called sparse) inverted index. Recently, deep learning solutions based on transformer networks have been used to enrich the statistical information about terms by rewriting or expanding the collection of documents. For instance, DeepCT [10] reweights terms occurring in the documents according to a fine-tuned BERT model to highlight important terms. This results in augmented document representations, which can be indexed using a traditional inverted indexer. Similarly, doc2query [33] and its more modern variant docT5query\n",

Language models take advantage of smoothing, usually Jelinek-Mercer or Dirichlet, in order to consider documents with missing query terms, or even documents with none of the query terms. A similar smoothing strategy is also explored in PageRank (see Equations A.2 and A.5 in Appendix A). By considering the prior probability of a term, we broaden the notion of relevance, taking into account query-independent evidence — i.e., a document might be relevant solely due to its terms, however it will often be less relevant than documents with a strong query-document relation. Divergence from randomness [119] is a probabilistic model where we measure the information gain of a term given a document. This model is a generalization of Harter’s indexing model [24], where two Poisson distributions (hence 2-Poisson) were combined in analogy to TF and IDF, using the notion of eliteness to describe documents with a more prominent presence of query terms, when compared to other documents. A similar approach is taken in divergence from randomness, but there is a wide range of models to select from, as opposed to only being able to use the Poisson distribution.\n",

We consider the top 100 documents (topk = 100) in the search ranking as search results for each query. 3.1.1 Building index for the documents For each foreign language, we created an index for the documents with 5 TextField as follows: • id: the unique index of the document • surface: the raw text of the document • tokens: the document after tokenization • subword: the document in SentencePiece subwords • char: the document in characters 3.1.2 Querying the document index During retrieval, each translated query is first pro￾cessed into its respective text representations (to￾kens, subwords or characters) and parsed using Lucene’s built-in query parser and analyzer. Addi￾tionally, we tried to improve the search results by combining and re-ranking the result sets from the different text representations. 3.1.3 Search result expansion Our intuition is that queries of more granular text representation can improve the robustness of the retrieval and potentially override the textual noise (e.g., misspellings are handled better for some lan￾guages).\n",
            "bd23ce64a6422c1f73acf51675e53b7a06547da3: Among the multi-lingual models, we investigate multilingual BERT (mBERT) (Pires et al., 2019) and XLM-RoBERTa (Conneau et al., 2020) which extends the corresponding pre-training over texts in more than 100 languages. Regardless of the adopted Transformer-based architecture, we also investigated the adoption of additional annotated material to support the training of complex networks over very short texts extracted from MEMEs. In particular, in Hate Speech Identification, we used an external dataset which addressed the same task, but within a different source. We thus adopted a dataset made available within the Hate Speech Detection (HaSpeeDe) task (Bosco et al., 2018) which in￾volves the automatic recognition of hateful con￾tents in Twitter (HaSpeeDe-TW) and Facebook posts (HaSpeeDe-FB). Each investigated architec￾ture is trained for few epochs only over on the HaSpeeDe dataset before the real training is ap￾plied to the DANKMEMES material. In this way, the neural model, which is not specifically pre-trained to detect hate speech, is expected to improve its “expertise” in handling such a phe￾nomenon (even though using material derived from a different source) before being specialized on the final DANKMEMES task3 . We trained UmBERTo both on HaSpeeDe-TW and on HaSpeeDe-FB and on the merging of these, too.\n",

A promising direction to alleviate the depen￾dence of Neu-IR models on large-scale relevance supervision is to leverage weak supervision signals that are noisy but available at mass quantity (Zheng et al., 2019b; Dehghani et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2020). Through IR history, various weak supervi￾sion sources have been used to approximate query￾document relevance signals, e.g., pseudo relevance labels generated by unsupervised retrieval meth￾ods (Dehghani et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2019b), and title-document pairs (MacAvaney et al., 2019). Recently, Zhang et al. (2020b) treat paired anchor texts and linked pages as weak relevance signals and propose a reinforcement-based data selection method ReInfoSelect, which learns to filter noisy anchor signals with trial-and-error policy gradients. Despite their convincing results, anchor signals are only available in web domains. Directly applying them to non-web domains may suffer from subopti￾mal outcomes due to domain gaps.

Preventing embedding drift A common approach to prevent forgetting is regularizing the weights with a quadratic term in the loss that penalizes the weighted Euclidean distance (in the parameter spaces) to the solution for previous tasks [27, 74, 1, 35]. This can help to avoid significant drift in the embeddings and to keep them discriminative for previous tasks.

In this paper, we propose a combination of both problems into a continual cross-modal retrieval setting, where we study how the catastrophic interference caused by new tasks impacts the embedding spaces and their cross-modal alignment required for effective retrieval. We propose a general framework that decouples the training, indexing and querying stages. We also identify and study different factors that may lead to forgetting, and propose tools to alleviate it.

In the era of Google Knowledge Graph and Microsoft Satori, users demand an effortless process of search. Whether they express an information need through a keyword query, expecting documents and entities, or through a clicked entity, expecting related entities, there is an inherent need for the combination of corpora and knowledge bases to obtain an answer. Such integration frequently relies on independent signals extracted from inverted indexes, and from quad indexes indirectly accessed through queries to a triplestore. However, relying on two separate representation models inhibits the effective cross-referencing of information, discarding otherwise available relations that could lead to a better ranking. Moreover, different retrieval tasks often demand separate implementations, although the problem is, at its core, the same. With the goal of harnessing all available information to optimize retrieval, we explore joint representation models of documents and entities, while taking a step towards the definition of a more general retrieval approach. Specifically, we propose that graphs should be used to incorporate explicit and implicit information derived from the relations between text found in corpora and entities found in knowledge bases. We also take advantage of this framework to elaborate a general model for entity-oriented search, proposing a universal ranking function for the tasks of ad hoc document retrieval (leveraging entities), ad hoc entity retrieval, and entity list completion. At a conceptual stage, we begin by proposing the graph-of-entity, based on the relations between combinations of term and entity nodes. We introduce the entity weight as the corresponding ranking function, relying on the idea of seed nodes for representing the query, either directly through term nodes, or based on the expansion to adjacent entity nodes. The score is computed based on a series of geodesic distances to the remaining nodes, providing a ranking for the documents (or entities) in the graph. In order to improve on the low scalability of the graph-of-entity, we then redesigned this model in a way that reduced the number of edges in relation to the number of nodes, by relying on the hypergraph data structure. The resulting model, which we called hypergraph-of-entity, is the main contribution of this thesis. The obtained reduction was achieved by replacing binary edges with n-ary relations based on sets of nodes and entities (undirected document hyperedges), sets of entities (undirected hyperedges, either based on cooccurrence or a grouping by semantic subject), and pairs of a set of terms and a set of one entity (directed hyperedges, mapping text to an object). We introduce the random walk score as the corresponding ranking function, relying on the same idea of seed nodes, similar to the entity weight in the graph-of-entity. Scoring based on this function is highly reliant on the structure of the hypergraph, which we call representation-driven retrieval. As such, we explore several extensions of the hypergraph-of-entity, including relations of synonymy, or contextual similarity, as well as different weighting functions per node and hyperedge type. We also propose TF-bins as a discretization for representing term frequency in the hypergraph-of-entity. For the random walk score, we propose and explore several parameters, including length and repeats, with or without seed node expansion, direction, or weights, and with or without a certain degree of node and/or hyperedge fatigue, a concept that we also propose.

To solve this problem, most approaches try to learn a joint embedding space to measure the cross-modal similarities, while paying little attention to the representation of each modality. Video is more complicated than the commonly used visual feature, since the audio and caption on the screen also contain rich information. Recently, the aggregations of multiple features in videos boost the benchmark of the video-text retrieval system. However, they usually handle each feature independently, which ignores the interchange of high-level semantic relations among these multiple features. Moreover, despite the inter-modal ranking constraint where semantically-similar texts and videos should stay closer, the modality-specific requirement, i.e. two similar videos/texts should have similar representations, is also significant. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Feature Graph ATtention Network (MFGATN) for cross-modal video-text retrieval. Specifically, we introduce a multi-feature graph attention module, which enriches the representation of each feature in videos with the interchange of high-level semantic information among them. Moreover, we elaborately design a novel Dual Constraint Ranking Loss (DCRL), which simultaneously considers the inter-modal ranking constraint and the intra-modal structure constraint to preserve both the cross-modal semantic similarity and the modality-specific consistency in the embedding space.

The standard neural code quest approaches present source code and query in the form of text as independent embedding, then calculate the semantic similarity between them using vector distance (e.g., using cosine similarity).

Recently, dense retrieval – through the use of neural contextual language models such as BERT for analysing the documents’ and queries’ contents and computing their relevance scores – has shown a promising performance on several information retrieval tasks still relying on the traditional inverted index for identifying documents relevant to a query. Two different dense retrieval families have emerged: the use of single embedded representations for each passage and query, e.g., using BERT’s [CLS] token, or via multiple representations, e.g., using an embedding for each token of the query and document (exemplified by ColBERT). In this work, we conduct the first study into the potential for multiple representation dense retrieval to be enhanced using pseudo-relevance feedback and present our proposed approach ColBERT-PRF. In particular, based on the pseudo-relevant set of documents identified using a first-pass dense retrieval, ColBERT-PRF extracts the representative feedback embeddings from the document embeddings of the pseudo-relevant set. Among the representative feedback embeddings, the embeddings that most highly discriminate among documents are employed as the expansion embeddings, which are then added to the original query representation. We show that these additional expansion embeddings both enhance the effectiveness of a reranking of the initial query results as well as an additional dense retrieval operation. Indeed, experiments on the MSMARCO passage ranking dataset show that MAP can be improved by up to 26% on the TREC 2019 query set and 10% on the TREC 2020 query set by the application of our proposed ColBERT-PRF method on a ColBERT dense retrieval approach.We further validate the effectiveness of our proposed pseudo-relevance feedback technique for a dense retrieval model on MSMARCO document ranking and TREC Robust04 document ranking tasks. For instance, ColBERT-PRF exhibits up to 21% and 14% improvement in MAP over the ColBERT E2E model on the MSMARCO document ranking TREC 2019 and TREC 2020 query sets, respectively. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of variants of the ColBERT-PRF model with different weighting methods.

Directly applying a traditional multi-label classification model for item tagging is sub-optimal, due to the ignorance of unique characteristics in IR. In this work, we propose to formulate item tagging as a link prediction problem between item nodes and tag nodes. To enrich the representation of items, we leverage the query logs available in IR tasks, and construct a query-item-tag tripartite graph.

We also take advantage of this framework to elaborate a general model for entity-oriented search, proposing a universal ranking function for the tasks of ad hoc document retrieval (leveraging entities), ad hoc entity retrieval, and entity list completion. At a conceptual stage, we begin by proposing the graph-of-entity, based on the relations between combinations of term and entity nodes. We introduce the entity weight as the corresponding ranking function, relying on the idea of seed nodes for representing the query, either directly through term nodes, or based on the expansion to adjacent entity nodes. The score is computed based on a series of geodesic distances to the remaining nodes, providing a ranking for the documents (or entities) in the graph. In order to improve on the low scalability of the graph-of-entity, we then redesigned this model in a way that reduced the number of edges in relation to the number of nodes, by relying on the hypergraph data structure. The resulting model, which we called hypergraph-of-entity, is the main contribution of this thesis. The obtained reduction was achieved by replacing binary edges with n-ary relations based on sets of nodes and entities (undirected document hyperedges), sets of entities (undirected hyperedges, either based on cooccurrence or a grouping by semantic subject), and pairs of a set of terms and a set of one entity (directed hyperedges, mapping text to an object). We introduce the random walk score as the corresponding ranking function, relying on the same idea of seed nodes, similar to the entity weight in the graph-of-entity. Scoring based on this function is highly reliant on the structure of the hypergraph, which we call representation-driven retrieval. As such, we explore several extensions of the hypergraph-of-entity, including relations of synonymy, or contextual similarity, as well as different weighting functions per node and hyperedge type. We also propose TF-bins as a discretization for representing term frequency in the hypergraph-of-entity. For the random walk score, we propose and explore several parameters, including length and repeats, with or without seed node expansion, direction, or weights, and with or without a certain degree of node and/or hyperedge fatigue, a concept that we also propose.

The task aims to predict age and gender of blogs users from their posts, as the topic they wrote about. Our proposal combines learned representations by RNN at word and sentence levels, Transformer Neural Nets and hand-crafted stylistic features. All these representations are mixed and fed into a fully connected layer from a feed-forward neural network in order to make predictions for addressed subtasks. Experimental results show that our model achieves encouraging performance. The growing integration of social media with people’s daily live has made this medium a common environment for the deployment of technologies that allow the retrieval of useful information in the development of business activities, social outreach processes, forensic tasks, etc. That is because people frequently upload and share content in these media with various purposes such as socialization of points of view about some topic or promotion of personal business, etc. The analysis of textual information from such data, is one of the main reasons why researches become trending on the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. However, the fact that this information varies greatly in terms of its format, even when it comes from the same person, besides textual sequences are unstructured information, make challenging the process of analyzing it automatically. Author Profiling (AP) task aims at discovering different marks or patterns (linguistic or not) from texts, that allow a user to be characterized in terms of Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

Many forums, due to the applicability of AP, share tasks directed to mining features that in general way, predict that valuable information. Those tasks commonly make special focus on popular languages such as English and Spanish. Nevertheless, other languages are explored on important forums too, that is the case of EVALITA 1, this one, promoting analysis of NLP tasks in the Italian language. Among the challenges from its last campaign EVALITA 2018 was the AP (in terms of gender) task GxG (Dell’Orletta and Nissim, 2018), exploring the gender-predicting issue. The analysis of age, gender and the topic a text is related with, are tasks well explored and the most approaches employ data representation based on stylistic features, n-gram representations and/or words embedding combined with Machine Learning (ML) methods like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (Pizarro, 2019). Also some authors by using Deep Learning (DL) models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) combined with stylistic features (Aragón and López-Monroy, 2018) (Bayot and Gonçalves, 2018) have yield encouraging performances. In this work we address precisely, the automatic detection of gender and age of the authors, besides the identification of the prevailing topic on textual information from blogs.

They are used extensively in various kinds of documents including web pages. Tables display information as a two-dimensional matrix, the semantics of which is conveyed by a mixture of structure (rows, columns), headers, caption, and content. Recent research has started to consider tables as first class objects, not just as an addendum to texts, yielding interesting results for problems like table matching, table completion, or value imputation. All of these problems inherently rely on an accurate measure for the semantic similarity of two tables. We present TabSim, a novel method to compute table similarity scores using deep neural networks. Conceptually, TabSim represents a table as a learned concatenation of embeddings of its caption, its content, and its structure. Given two tables in this representation, a Siamese neural network is trained to compute a score correlating with the tables’ semantic similarity. To train and evaluate our method, we created a gold standard corpus consisting of 1500 table pairs extracted from biomedical articles and manually scored regarding their degree of similarity, and adopted two other corpora originally developed for a different yet similar task. Our evaluation shows that TabSim outperforms other table similarity measures on average by app. 7% pp F1-score in a binary similarity classification setting and by app. 1.5% pp in a ranking scenario.

Therefore, it is important to study potential adversarial attacks to identify vulnerabilities of NRMs before they are deployed. In this paper, we introduce the Word Substitution Ranking Attack (WSRA) task against NRMs, which aims to promote a target document in rankings by adding adversarial perturbations to its text.

The neural IR community made great advancements in training effective dual-encoder dense retrieval (DR) models recently. A dense text retrieval model uses a single vector representation per query and passage to score a match, which enables low-latency first-stage retrieval with a nearest neighbor search. Increasingly common, training approaches require enormous compute power, as they either conduct negative passage sampling out of a continuously updating refreshing index or require very large batch sizes. Instead of relying on more compute capability, we introduce an efficient topic-aware query and balanced margin sampling technique, called TAS-Balanced. We cluster queries once before training and sample queries out of a cluster per batch. We train our lightweight 6-layer DR model with a novel dual-teacher supervision that combines pairwise and in-batch negative teachers. Our method is trainable on a single consumer-grade GPU in under 48 hours. We show that our TAS-Balanced training method achieves state-of-the-art low-latency (64ms per query) results on two TREC Deep Learning Track query sets.

Recently, dense retrieval -- through the use of neural contextual language models such as BERT for analysing the documents' and queries' contents and computing their relevance scores -- has shown a promising performance on several information retrieval tasks still relying on the traditional inverted index for identifying documents relevant to a query. Two different dense retrieval families have emerged: the use of single embedded representations for each passage and query (e.g. using BERT's [CLS] token), or via multiple representations (e.g. using an embedding for each token of the query and document). In this work, we conduct the first study into the potential for multiple representation dense retrieval to be enhanced using pseudo-relevance feedback. In particular, based on the pseudo-relevant set of documents identified using a first-pass dense retrieval, we extract representative feedback embeddings (using KMeans clustering) -- while ensuring that these embeddings discriminate among passages (based on IDF) -- which are then added to the query representation. These additional feedback embeddings are shown to both enhance the effectiveness of a reranking as well as an additional dense retrieval operation. Indeed, experiments on the MSMARCO passage ranking dataset show that MAP can be improved by upto 26% on the TREC 2019 query set and 10% on the TREC 2020 query set by the application of our proposed ColBERT-PRF method on a ColBERT dense retrieval approach.\", 'citationCount': 40, 'referenceCount': 35, 'journal': {'name': 'Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGIR International Conference on Theory of Information Retrieval'}}), 124.064575), (Document(page_content='Universal Multimodal Representation for Language Understanding [SEP] Recent studies have followed the two-path architecture [45, 46], in which the encoder consists of a joint embedding of textual and image representations extracted from both the images and corresponding caption.

When the items being retrieved are documents, the time and memory cost of employing Transformers over a full sequence of document terms can be prohibitive. A popular strategy involves considering only the first n terms of the document. This can, however, result in a biased system that under retrieves longer documents. In this work, we propose a local self-attention which considers a moving window over the document terms and for each term attends only to other terms in the same window. This local attention incurs a fraction of the compute and memory cost of attention over the whole document. The windowed approach also leads to more compact packing of padded documents in minibatches resulting in additional savings. We also employ a learned saturation function and a two-staged pooling strategy to identify relevant regions of the document. The Transformer-Kernel pooling model with these changes can efficiently elicit relevance information from documents with thousands of tokens.

Yu et al.  utilises graph transformers to capture the PRF signals from the initial retrieved results, and Wang et al.  proposed a clustering method to gather the relevance signals from PRF documents. These methods show remarkable improvements, but the efficiency is significantly affected, such as BERT-QE inference requires 11.01x more computations than BERT alone, making these models computationally infeasible for many practical applications. Recently, dense retrievers [29,16,7,8,6] have been attracting a lot of attention from researchers.

For AMI (Elis￾abetta Fersini, 2020), the second shared task at the 7th evaluation campaign EVALITA 2020 (Basile et al., 2020). Given the huge amount of user￾generated content on the Web, and in particular on social media, the problem of detecting, in order to possibly limit the diffusion of hate speech against women, is rapidly becoming fundamental espe￾cially for the societal impact of the phenomenon, it is very important to identify misogyny in social media. 1.1 Hate Speech (HaSpeeDe 2) In recent years, with the acceleration of infor￾mation dissemination, the identification of hate speech and offense language has become a crucial mission in multilingual sentiment analysis field￾s and has attracted the attention of a large num￾ber of industrial and academic researchers. From an NLP perspective, much attention has been paid to the topic of HS - together with all its possi￾ble facets and related phenomena, such as offen￾sive/abusive language, and its identification. This is shown by the proliferation, especially in the last few years, of contributions on this topic (e.g. 1 http://www.evalita.it/2020/tasks103 Caselli et al. (2020), Jurgens et al. (2019), Fortuna et al. (2019)), corpora and lexica (e.g. de Pelle and Moreira (2017), (Sanguinetti et al., 2018), (Bassignana et al., 2018)), dedicated workshop￾s, and shared tasks within national (GermEval 2 , HASOC 3 , IberLEF 4 ) and international (Se￾mEval 5 ) evaluation campaigns.

Because of this, Amharic  NLP tasks have been performed using classical text representations such as stems and  roots [42,43], and the impact of learned text representations on roots, stems, and words to  the development of various applications is not yet investigated. Thus, the construction of  pre-trained Amharic models is a long sought resource for the research community. In  view of this, the major contributions of this work are: (i) construction of pre-trained Am￾haric models and publicly sharing them to the research community; (ii) fine-tuning the  pre-trained models for NLP and IR tasks; and (iii) investigation of the effects of roots,  stems, and surface words on learned text representations.  \u001b[0m\n",

Preventing forgetting In the following we propose several tools to alleviate for￾getting by addressing the previous causes. 5.1. Preventing embedding drift A common approach to prevent forgetting is regularizing the weights with a quadratic term in the loss that penalizes the weighted Euclidean distance (in the parameter spaces) to the solution for previous tasks [27, 74, 1, 35]. This can help to avoid significant drift in the embeddings and to keep them discriminative for previous tasks. We can write the particular regularization term for our case as LR = X k Θ (t−1) k \u0010 θ (t−1) k −θk \u00112 + + X k0 Ω (t−1) k0 \u0010 ω (t−1) k0 −ωk0 \u00112\u001b[0m\n",

Hypergraph structure acts as a constraint for random walking — while random walks in the Euclidean space can essentially take a step in any direction, in hyper￾graphs they are restricted to taking steps within the structure of the hypergraph. The idea of fatigue that we explore here is simply an added restriction, similar to the one we introduce when moving from the Euclidean space to a hypergraph space. Regarding fatigued random walks, it would be interesting to reiterate over the com￾putation approach of Fatigued PageRank, exploring a more approximate analogy to the combination of PageRank and Reverse PageRank, replacing the k ∗ vector with the Markov matrix used in Reverse PageRank and studying the differences. As￾suming we could represent hypergraph-of-entity as a tensor, we could also attempt to introduce the concept of fatigue in the Multilinear PageRank, so that we could completely rebuild the random walk score in its algebraic version, solvable through power iteration or other available, more efficient methods of PageRank computation, such as Monte Carlo (see Section A.2). 11.3.4 Promoting generalization through new applications We proposed what is, to our knowledge, the first general model for information re￾trieval.\u001b[0m\n",

When all hyperedges in a hypergraph contain the same number k of nodes, the hypergraph is said to be k-uniform. In that case, it can be represented as a tensor of k dimensions, each of size |V|.

Language models take advantage of smoothing, usually Jelinek-Mercer or Dirichlet, in order to consider documents with missing query terms, or even documents with none of the query terms. A similar smoothing strategy is also explored in PageRank (see Equations A.2 and A.5 in Appendix A). By considering the prior probability of a term, we broaden the notion of relevance, taking into account query-independent evidence — i.e., a document might be relevant solely due to its terms, however it will often be less relevant than documents with a strong query-document relation. Divergence from randomness  is a probabilistic model where we measure the information gain of a term given a document. This model is a generalization of Harter’s indexing model , where two Poisson distributions (hence 2-Poisson) were combined in analogy to TF and IDF, using the notion of eliteness to describe documents with a more prominent presence of query terms, when compared to other documents. A similar approach is taken in divergence from randomness, but there is a wide range of models to select from, as opposed to only being able to use the Poisson distribution.\u001b[0m\n",

Furthermore, two cross-platform sub-tasks were introduced to test the systems’ ability to generalize across platforms. The ultimate goal of HaSpeeDe 2 at EVALITA 2020 (Basile et al., 2020) is to take a step further in state-of-the-art HS detection for Italian. By do￾ing this, we also intend to explore other side phe￾nomena and see the extent to which they can be automatically distinguished from HS. We propose a single training set made of tweets, but two separate test sets within two different do￾mains: tweets and news headlines. While social media are still one of the main channels used to spread hateful content online (Alkiviadou, 2019; Wodak, 2018), an important role in this respect is also played by traditional media, and newspapers in particular.

We consider the top 100 documents (topk = 100) in the search ranking as search results for each query. 3.1.1 Building index for the documents For each foreign language, we created an index for the documents with 5 TextField as follows: • id: the unique index of the document • surface: the raw text of the document • tokens: the document after tokenization • subword: the document in SentencePiece subwords • char: the document in characters 3.1.2 Querying the document index During retrieval, each translated query is first pro￾cessed into its respective text representations (to￾kens, subwords or characters) and parsed using Lucene’s built-in query parser and analyzer. Addi￾tionally, we tried to improve the search results by combining and re-ranking the result sets from the different text representations. 3.1.3 Search result expansion Our intuition is that queries of more granular text representation can improve the robustness of the retrieval and potentially override the textual noise (e.g., misspellings are handled better for some lan￾guages).\u001b[0m\n",

Regardless of the adopted Transformer-based architecture, we also investigated the adoption of additional annotated material to support the training of complex networks over very short texts extracted from MEMEs. In particular, in Hate Speech Identification, we used an external dataset which addressed the same task, but within a different source. We thus adopted a dataset made available within the Hate Speech Detection (HaSpeeDe) task (Bosco et al., 2018) which in￾volves the automatic recognition of hateful con￾tents in Twitter (HaSpeeDe-TW) and Facebook posts (HaSpeeDe-FB). Each investigated architec￾ture is trained for few epochs only over on the HaSpeeDe dataset before the real training is ap￾plied to the DANKMEMES material. In this way, the neural model, which is not specifically pre-trained to detect hate speech, is expected to improve its “expertise” in handling such a phe￾nomenon (even though using material derived from a different source) before being specialized on the final DANKMEMES task3 .

A promising direction to alleviate the depen￾dence of Neu-IR models on large-scale relevance supervision is to leverage weak supervision signals that are noisy but available at mass quantity (Zheng et al., 2019b; Dehghani et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2020). Through IR history, various weak supervi￾sion sources have been used to approximate query￾document relevance signals, e.g., pseudo relevance labels generated by unsupervised retrieval meth￾ods (Dehghani et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2019b), and title-document pairs (MacAvaney et al., 2019). Recently, Zhang et al. (2020b) treat paired anchor texts and linked pages as weak relevance signals and propose a reinforcement-based data selection method ReInfoSelect, which learns to filter noisy anchor signals with trial-and-error policy gradients. Despite their convincing results, anchor signals are only available in web domains. Directly applying them to non-web domains may suffer from subopti￾mal outcomes due to domain gaps. To obtain weak supervision that adapts arbitrary domains, Ma et al.\u001b[0m\n",

            "\n",
            "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in cross-modal retrieval, which aims to retrieve relevant information from one modality (e.g., text) given a query from another modality (e.g., image). This task is challenging due to the inherent semantic gap between different modalities. To bridge this gap, various approaches have been proposed, including the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for text-image matching. In this section, we review the literature on text-image matching for cross-modal retrieval via GNNs.\n",
            "\n",
            "One popular approach for text-image matching is to represent textual and visual data as embeddings in a shared latent space. These embeddings capture the semantic information of the data and enable effective matching between different modalities. One such method is Sentence-BERT [REF0], which utilizes Siamese BERT networks to generate sentence embeddings. By training the network on a large amount of sentence pairs, Sentence-BERT learns to encode the semantic similarity between sentences. This approach has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various natural language processing tasks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another approach is to leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) for text-image matching. GNNs are powerful models that can capture complex relationships between entities in a graph structure. In the context of cross-modal retrieval, GNNs can be used to model the relationships between words in text and visual features in images. For example, Yu et al. [REF2] proposed a neural pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) approach that uses a feed-forward neural network model to aggregate the query and feedback document relevance scores and provide the target document's relevance score. This method utilizes graph transformers to capture the PRF signals from the initial retrieved results. Similarly, Wang et al. [REF2] proposed a clustering method to gather the relevance signals from PRF documents. These methods have shown remarkable improvements in cross-modal retrieval, but their efficiency is significantly affected, making them computationally infeasible for many practical applications.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to GNNs, other models based on BERT have also been applied to text-image matching. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-training model that has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various natural language processing tasks [REF6]. For example, dense retrievers [REF2] often utilize a BERT-based dual-encoder to encode queries and passages into a shared embedding space. These models have shown great effectiveness and efficiency in various tasks and datasets.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, text-image matching for cross-modal retrieval via graph neural networks is an active area of research. Various approaches, including Sentence-BERT, GNNs, and BERT-based models, have been proposed to address the challenges of cross-modal retrieval. These models have shown promising results in capturing the semantic relationships between text and images. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of efficiency and scalability. Future research could focus on developing more efficient and scalable models for text-image matching in cross-modal retrieval tasks.\n",

            "\n",
            "In the field of Crosslingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), the representation of textual data plays a crucial role in achieving accurate and effective retrieval results. Various approaches have been proposed to represent text in a crosslingual setting, taking into account the challenges posed by different languages and the need for efficient and accurate retrieval. In this section, we discuss some of the key textual representations used in CLIR and their impact on retrieval performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "One approach to textual representation in CLIR is the use of multilingual embeddings. Multilingual embeddings, such as multilingual BERT (mBERT) and XLM-RoBERTa, have been widely adopted in CLIR tasks [REF8]. These models leverage pre-training over texts in multiple languages to learn crosslingual representations that capture semantic similarities across languages. By using these embeddings, CLIR systems can effectively bridge the language gap and retrieve relevant information across different languages.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another approach to textual representation in CLIR is the use of neural network architectures, such as Transformers and RNNs. Transformers, in particular, have shown promising results in various natural language processing tasks, including machine translation [REF6]. These models can capture contextual information and dependencies between words, enabling them to generate rich representations for text. RNNs, on the other hand, are commonly used for encoding sequential data and have been applied to encode sentence embeddings in the same space as image representations [REF5]. These architectures provide a powerful means of representing text in a crosslingual setting.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to neural network architectures, other methods have been proposed for textual representation in CLIR. For example, feature ensembles have been used to combine representations from different sources [REF2]. This approach aims to leverage the strengths of each source and improve the overall representation quality. Furthermore, weak supervision signals have been explored to approximate query-document relevance signals, such as pseudo relevance labels generated by unsupervised retrieval methods [REF9]. These signals, although noisy, can provide valuable information for training CLIR models and improving retrieval performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Evaluation of different textual representations in CLIR is typically done using metrics such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Precision at K (P@K) [REF1]. These metrics measure the effectiveness of the retrieval system in ranking relevant documents higher than irrelevant ones. Experimental results have shown that certain textual representations, such as multilingual embeddings and neural network architectures, outperform traditional methods like Jaccard and Cosine similarity in terms of retrieval performance [REF1].\n",
            "\n",
            "In conclusion, the choice of textual representation plays a crucial role in the success of Crosslingual Information Retrieval systems. Multilingual embeddings, neural network architectures, and feature ensembles are some of the approaches that have shown promising results in representing text in a crosslingual setting. By leveraging these representations, CLIR systems can bridge the language gap and retrieve relevant information across different languages effectively.\n",

Furthermore, two cross-platform sub-tasks were introduced to test the systems’ ability to generalize across platforms. The ultimate goal of HaSpeeDe 2 at EVALITA 2020 (Basile et al., 2020) is to take a step further in state-of-the-art HS detection for Italian. By do￾ing this, we also intend to explore other side phe￾nomena and see the extent to which they can be automatically distinguished from HS. We propose a single training set made of tweets, but two separate test sets within two different do￾mains: tweets and news headlines. While social media are still one of the main channels used to spread hateful content online (Alkiviadou, 2019; Wodak, 2018), an important role in this respect is also played by traditional media, and newspapers in particular. Furthermore, we chose to include another HS￾related phenomenon, namely the presence of stereotypes referring to one of the targets identi￾fied within our dataset (i.e., muslims, Roma and immigrants).\n",
