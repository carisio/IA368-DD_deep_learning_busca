    "Objetivo: gerar dataset para treino de modelos de buscas usando a técnica do InPars e avaliar um modelo reranqueador treinado neste dataset no TREC-COVID:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Entrada: 3-5 exemplos few-shot + documento amostrado da coleção do TREC-COVID\n",
    "    - Saída: query que seja relevante para o documento amostrado\n",
    "    - É opcional fazer a etapa de filtragem usando as queries de maior prob descrita no Artigo.   \n",
    "    - Como modelo gerador, use um dos seguintes modelos:\n",
    "        - ChatGPT-3.5-turbo: ~1 USD para cada 1k exemplos\n",
    "        - FLAN-T5 (base, large ou XL), LLAMA-(7,13B), Alpaca-(7/13B), que são possiveis de rodar no Colab Pro.\n",
    "        - Também tem a inference-api da HF: https://huggingface.co/inference-api.\n",
    "        - Com exceção do LLAMA, é possivel usar zero-shot ao inves de few-shot.\n",
    "    - Dado 1k-10k pares <query sintética; documento>, treinar um modelo reranqueador miniLM igual ao da aula 2/3.\n",
    "    - Exemplos negativos (i.e., <query sintética; doc não relevant) vem do BM25: dado a query sintetica, retornar top 1000 com o BM25, e amostrar aleatoriamente alguns documentos como negativo\n",
